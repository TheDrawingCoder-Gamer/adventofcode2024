  // The "right edge" (the first row) has the triangle numbers (named sumtorial here)
  // if there was a way to translate X Y (in the puzzle space) to R C (row column in floyd's triangle),
  // I could trivially get the number.
  // Based off of a drawing, I think that R will = X - 1 + Y
  // I think that C will = X
  // Given R and C, the answer should be sumtorial(R - 1) + C
  // Sumtorial of R - 1 will give us the very last number of the previous row,
  // and then we add C to get our current number.
